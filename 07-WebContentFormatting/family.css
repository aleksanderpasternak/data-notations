/*
Add space between form fields: Use the margin-bottom property to add space between each form element. This will make the form look more organized and easier to read.

Change the font: Use the font-family property to change the font used in the form to a more modern or readable font, such as Arial or Verdana.

Style the submit button: Use the background-color and color properties to change the background color of the submit button and the text color. Make it stand out by giving it a different style.

Add a border to input fields: Use the border property to give the text fields (input, select, textarea) a simple border, making them more defined.

Change the width of the form fields: Use the width property to make the form fields wider (e.g., width: 100%), so that they stretch across the available space and are easier to fill out.
